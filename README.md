# Science Olympics 2022

This repo will host our work during the APEGA Science Olympics 2022. So yeah, here comes our chance to kick Grandview's *ss again.

## Overview
Our portable rescue device is a telescopic, accordion-like stretcher that can extend from a compact box to triple its length. The frame securely holds a tarp along with straps to support the weight of the user. It is also equipped with a pair of wheels to assist in moving the user to safety in solo. 

## Composition
As much as we would want to use carbon fiber tubes to build this stretcher, the budget has been set to $50, therefore, we are going to use PVC pipes (preferably reused from an existing build) to build the frame. For the accordion part, we are going to use flat steel plates in the shape of Popsicle sticks with 2 holes on either end and fasten them together with well-oiled bolts. The plates will alternate between front and back to allow them to close together to contract. The bed area will be a plastic tarp tightly fastened to the frame using steel wires, hooks, and strong adhesives, along with 2 elastic straps on the bottom to support it. For the wheels, we will find a small pair of whatever we could find at home depot and a pair of sturdy springs for shock absorption. 

## Mechanics
The stretcher is held together by PVC pipes, as mentioned above, and shrinks by pushing smaller PVC pipes in the middle into the bigger ones near the edges, along with the metal plates which would contract by closing the individual triangles. The triangle formation on the sides of the stretcher add strength to the structure while also keeping it lightweight and retractable. The wheels assisting the operator are shock-absorbent, due to the springs suspending the pipes attached to the wheels, because hiking trails are rough. It can be folded on to the back side when not needed. 

## Usage
The stretcher is pulled outwards from both the sides and the lengths, revealing the PVC pipes covered by the ones on the ends and lengthening the stretcher. When fully extended, the operator folds out the wheels and carefully positions the user on to the top side of the stretcher. When there are 2 operators, the wheels are not needed as it is only a convenience for when only one operator is present. The user lays their  lower head on the cushioned part of the frame at the front of the stretcher, while laying their lower legs (halfway down their knees) on the other side of the stretcher. When the rescue is complete, the operator(s) fold the wheels back, push the stretcher inwards lengthwise, and then widthwise, and loops the bottom straps around the top for secure storage. 

## Viewing
We strongly recommend dowloading [the project](https://github.com/william-exe-v4/Science-Olympics-2022-stretcher/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and opening `project.dxf` in your preferred CAD program of choice. We recommend [Librecad](https://librecad.org/), though [qcad](https://www.qcad.org/en/) and [autocad](https://www.autodesk.ca/en/products/autocad/overview) (proprietary and paid software) should work too. We also recommend switching the units to cm (<ins>Options</ins> - `Current Drawing Preferences` - <ins>Units</ins> - `Main drawing unit: Centimeter`) and enabling isometric grid (<ins>Options</ins> - `Current Drawing Prefereces` - <ins>Grid</ins> - Grid Settings - `Isometric Grid`). To zoom, use the scrollwheel and to pan (move around), drag the mouse while holding down middle click.
